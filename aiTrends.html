          <p>
            Do Alexa, automated chatbots, robots or self-driving vehicles
            intrigue you? If they do, then you must know that they are all based
            on the technology of “AI” or “artificial intelligence”. AI is a
            branch of computer science, developed on the basis of those
            computer-based programs which possess the power of replicating human
            behavior.

            ChatGPT has given a glimpse of AI and generated quite a buzz about
            its astounding progress to the entire world. This new AI chatbot
            allows its users to engage in human-like conversations, which can
            respond to your questions immediately and helps you with tasks, such
            as composing emails, essays, and code. ChatGPT has a huge impact on
            employment and productivity as well.

          <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
          <p>
            The above-mentioned AI based statistics and data clearly shows how
            AI could be the most transformative technology that the world has
            ever witnessed. Machine intelligence is already playing a huge role
            in the Amazons and the Apples of the world and gradually becoming a
            part of other verticals as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            The big data companies and global economies are eventually coping up
            with the new changes and forming policies which are best aligned
            with the AI-powered technologies. Therefore, to label AI as “good”
            or “evil” will not help, but all the aspects of AI-based development
            deserve our inspection and attentiveness. It is important to balance
            and address these apprehensions, without underestimating the full
            potential of AI and its multiple use cases.
